# Overview

UFDS is the "unified foundational directory service" built for SDC over
[ldapjs](http://ldapjs.org) and [moray](https://mo.joyent.com/docs/moray/master/),
and is used to track accounts, credentials, and more. It is a superset of
functionality offered by previous SDC versions employing CAPI (there is a
backwards compatible "shim" that offers the same API as CAPI did in SDC 6.5).

# Development

    git clone git@git.joyent.com:ufds.git
    cd ufds
    git submodule update --init
    make all
    node main.js -f ./etc/ufds.laptop.config.json -d 2 2>&1 | bunyan

This assumes several things:

- You've got a moray instance running exactly how it's specified on the
  config file `ufds.laptop.config.json`.
- Your node version is greater than 0.6 (package says 0.7, but it's working OK
  with 0.6.x so far).
- You want to see debug output. If you don't, remove the `-d 2`, but it's
  strongly recommended while hacking.
- You do have bunyan module installed globally. Given the `make all` command
  should also install it locally, you could also replace that with
  `./node_modules/.bin/bunyan`.

# Testing

File by file:

    ./node_modules/.bin/nodeunit test/add.test.js

or the make task for this file:

    make add_test

The following make tasks are available:

    add_test
    bind_test
    compare_test
    del_test
    mod_test
    search_test

Of course, if you run `make test` all these tasks will run.
